	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is a type of computational complexity that describes the time required to execute an algorithm. 
		The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time it takes for each statement to complete. As a result, it is highly dependent on the size of the processed data. 
		An efficient algorithm has a lower time complexity.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of its input. It is an important factor to consider when designing algorithms, especially when dealing with large datasets. The space complexity of an algorithm is often expressed in terms of O(n).
